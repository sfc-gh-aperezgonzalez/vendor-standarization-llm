# Vendor Standardization with Snowflake Cortex AI

AI-powered vendor standardization using Snowflake Cortex AI and LLMs. Demonstrates corporate hierarchy extraction (L1/L2/L3) from messy vendor names with 80%+ accuracy using few-shot prompting and structured JSON outputs.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Project Overview**

This repository contains a **Snowflake Notebook** that demonstrates how to use **Snowflake Cortex AI's `AI_COMPLETE` function** to automatically standardize vendor names into a clean 3-level corporate hierarchy:

- **L1 (Global Parent)**: Ultimate holding company (e.g., "IBM", "BNP Paribas Group")
- **L2 (Regional Parent)**: Regional subsidiary (e.g., "IBM Canada", "Arval Belgium") 
- **L3 (Local Entity)**: Specific legal entity (e.g., "IBM CANADA LTD")

## ðŸš€ **Key Results**

- âœ… **80%+ L1 accuracy** on real-world vendor data
- âœ… **Cost-effective processing** at under $10 per 1,000 vendors on LLM inference
- âœ… **Production-ready implementation** using pure LLM reasoning
- âœ… **Scalable batch processing** for enterprise datasets
